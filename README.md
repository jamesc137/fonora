# Fonora — Phonetic Symbol Research Tool

A lightweight single-page web app for testing an experimental phonetic writing system. This is a research tool, not a constructed-language game.

## Architecture

```
Text → eSpeak NG → IPA → ipa-normalize.js → encodeSounds() → Fonora symbols
```

Fonora is language-agnostic. English, Spanish, French, German, Japanese, Arabic, Mandarin, and more flow through the same pronunciation layer.

  Text --> ES[eSpeak NG]
  ES --> IPA[IPA normalize]
  IPA --> Fonora[Fonora symbols]
  Fonora --> Decode[decode.js]
```

## What it does

- Loads symbol rules from `language-rules.md` at runtime
- IPA pipeline: eSpeak NG → IPA → Fonora phonemes → symbols
- Symbol keyboard with number/letter shortcuts and clickable buttons
- Place × manner sound grid
- Live decode panel with spacing normalization
- Reverse sound → symbol lookup
- Simple decode/construct quiz mode for all encodable sounds (session stats only)
- Mini dictionary with localStorage persistence
- Translator with language selection
- Pronunciation Testing tab for IPA → Fonora evaluation

## Run locally

Install dependencies (copies eSpeak NG WASM to `vendor/espeak-ng/`):

```bash
cd fonora
npm install
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

Browsers block `fetch()` and WASM loading when opening HTML files directly (`file://`). Always use a local HTTP server.

## Editing rules

Edit `language-rules.md` and reload the browser. Changes to symbols, keyboard mappings, sounds, labels, and undefined cells update automatically.

If the Markdown file cannot be loaded, the app falls back to embedded rules and shows a warning banner.

## eSpeak NG

See [docs/espeak-integration.md](docs/espeak-integration.md) for voice codes, WASM setup, GPL license note, and browser compatibility.

## Dictionary

Glossary entries are stored in browser `localStorage` under the key `fonora-glossary-v1`. Dictionary entries override the IPA pipeline for known words.

## Tests

```bash
npm test
```

Or open the app with `?test` in the URL to log test results in the browser console.
