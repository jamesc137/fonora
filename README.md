# Fonora

**[fonora.org](https://fonora.org)** — an open-source phonetic oral script language.

Fonora is an experimental writing system built from nine core symbols that represent where and how speech sounds are produced. This repository contains the language rules, research documentation, and the interactive web app used to test translation, reading, and validation.

```
Text → eSpeak NG → IPA → ipa-normalize.js → encodeSounds() → Fonora symbols
```

Rules version: **v3** ([`docs/language-rules.md`](docs/language-rules.md) — vowel grammar `⚬X`, diphthong `⚬XᵔY`).

## Live site

**https://fonora.org**

## Features

- Project homepage with live symbol reference
- **Translator** — text → IPA → Fonora (multilingual)
- **Reader** — neural Piper TTS from Fonora IPA
- **Sound Grid** — place × manner reference
- **Alphabet** — primary symbol experiments + phoneme inventory
- **Quiz** — decode or construct practice
- Pronunciation testing and automated IPA round-trip validation

See [docs/README.md](docs/README.md) for the full documentation index.

## Tests

```bash
npm test                              # 48 unit/integration assertions
npm run test:vowels                   # vowel readability report → reports/
npm run test:minimal-pairs            # minimal-pair distinctness report → reports/
npm run audit:collisions              # collision audit → docs/FONORA_COLLISION_AUDIT.md
npm run test:pronunciation-validation # IPA round-trip batch report → reports/
```

| Command | UI equivalent |
| --- | --- |
| `npm test` | Append `?test` to the app URL (browser console) |
| `npm run test:pronunciation-validation` | Pronunciation Validation tab |
