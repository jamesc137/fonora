# Fonora documentation

Index of project docs. See **[platform-overview.md](platform-overview.md)** for the section map (Fonora, Script, Language, Research, Tools) and the project's hypothesis.

For the *story* of how the project evolved — each experiment as a research note — see the **[Research notebook](/research)** and its **[timeline](/research/timeline)**. The notebook is the narrative layer; the docs below are the reference layer it links to.

**Authoritative symbol rules:** [language-rules.md](language-rules.md) (`fonora_version: v3`).

Narrative research notes (one per major experiment), authored in `docs/research/`. Open the rendered notebook at [/research](/research); each note links back to the reference docs and tools below.

| Era | Notes |

| Act I — Writing sound | the articulation grid, IPA pipeline, vowel v2 → v3, multilingual script, collision audit |
| Act II — Inventing a language | Gen 1/2 roots, Gen 3 DDA, Gen 3.1 distinctiveness, the 200-primitive allocation |
| Act III — A usable language | semantic foundation, the Constitution, the editorial pipeline, grammar particles, the translator, typing, puzzle conversation |
