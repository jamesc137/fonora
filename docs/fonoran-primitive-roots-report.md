Algorithmic assignment of ~200 semantic primitives to phonetically ranked syllables, following [fonoran-grammar.md](fonoran-grammar.md).

## Summary

| Metric | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Concepts assigned | 200 |
| **Total vocabulary** | **281** (200 primitives + 81 compounds) |
| Unresolved compounds | 0 |
| Syllable pool size | 407 |
| Reserved particles | mi, ta, na |
| Excluded syllables | pi, pee, po, poo |
| Shortest root | ba (person) |
| Longest root | dabe |

## Prior generator evaluation

| Generation | Approach | Adaptable? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Gen 1 | Hand roots + grammar vowels (a/e/i/o/u inflection) | **No** — violates invariant-word grammar |
| Gen 2 | Coordinate → grid + IE collision repair | **No** — concept-first, not grid-native |
| Gen 3 / 3.1 | 36 DDA primitives → phonetic spread | **Partially** — reused `distinctivenessPenalty` scoring |
| **This run** | 200 ranked human primitives → Huffman-like syllable allocation | **New** — `tools/fonoran-primitive-roots.js` |

## Scoring methodology

Concepts are sorted by **fundamentality priority** (1000 = most foundational). Each concept receives a **target phonetic cost** linearly mapped from priority — a Huffman-like principle where frequent/fundamental concepts should have the lowest phonetic cost.

For each concept, the generator evaluates every available syllable in the pool:

1. **Phonetic cost mismatch** — `|syllable_cost − target_cost| × 12`
2. **Distinctiveness** — adapted from Gen 3.1 (`fonoran-gen3-distinctiveness.js`): duplicate roots, prefix overlaps, rhyme clustering, onset similarity
3. **Particle flow**: penalizes roots that echo particles in `mi ___`, `mi ta ___`, `mi na ___`
4. **Compound flow** — penalizes awkward concatenations with recently assigned roots
5. **Distribution caps** — soft limits on rhyme class and onset reuse
6. **Tier gates** — top-priority concepts blocked from CVC/CV-CV; relaxed for lower deciles

### Syllable pool tiers (lowest cost first)

1. Preferred onsets (`b d f g k l m n s t`) + vowel `a`
2. Same onsets + other vowels (`e i o u`)
3. Secondary onsets (`h w y`)
4. Tertiary onsets (`p ch sh j r`) — `p` only with safe vowels; `pi`/`po` excluded
5. CVC extensions
6. Disyllabic CV-CV for lowest-priority concepts

## Priority ↔ phonetic cost correlation

| Decile | Priority range | Avg cost | Avg length | Samples |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| 1 | 981–1000 | 9.7 | 2 | ba (person), de (self), fi (do) |
| 2 | 961–980 | 25.9 | 2.3 | che (move), shu (speak), no (give) |
| 3 | 941–960 | 43.7 | 2.7 | pe (some), nu (other), ja (same) |
| 4 | 921–940 | 55.4 | 3 | bem (small), dat (good), fas (bad) |
| 5 | 901–920 | 56.3 | 3 | kes (hold), nel (use), sak (need) |
| 6 | 881–900 | 56.4 | 3 | sas (pulse), nam (cycle), sen (signal) |
| 7 | 861–880 | 63 | 3.3 | tek (understand), mas (learn), fal (teach) |
| 8 | 841–860 | 59.1 | 3.2 | kage (wave), tat (weave), nas (lattice) |
| 9 | 821–840 | 62.9 | 3.3 | li (how), gabe (if), do (because) |
| 10 | 801–820 | 68 | 3.4 | nafe (voice), lu (sound), lel (touch) |

## Template distribution

- **CVC**: 101
- **CV**: 62
- **CV-CV**: 37

## Sample compound probes

| Concepts | Compound |
| --- | --- |
| person + collective | **balo** |
| water + fire | **wagu** |
| love + person | **yaba** |
| inside + container | **wesan** |
| speak + signal | **shusen** |
| move + path | **chenan** |
| light + dark | **mopa** |
| give + take | **noti** |
| life + death | **sishe** |
| know + unknown | **mesek** |

## Tradeoffs and heuristics

- **Fundamentality scores are author-curated**, not corpus-derived. A future pass could seed priorities from semantic dependency graphs or Swadesh-style lists.
- **Grammar doc examples** (`ka`, `sha`, `kaso`, `fa`) are illustrative placeholders; this run does not preserve them — compare output before any canonical merge.
- **Particle reservation** is conservative (`mi`, `la`, `ta`, `na`). Future particles (negation, future tense) may require re-reservation.
- **`p` onset** is deprioritized and `pi`/`po` blocked; this shrinks the pool but avoids English bathroom humor.
- **CVC and disyllabic forms** absorb lowest-priority concepts when CV inventory exhausts — expect longer forms below priority ~850.
- **Compound flow** uses local pairwise checks only; full-tree pronounceability needs human review.
- **Excluded composites** (tribe, family, language, …) are not primitive roots — they appear as **transparent compounds** in the vocabulary layer.

## Vocabulary (English → Fonoran)

Each primitive is a standalone word. Complex English concepts are **compound words** built by concatenating primitive roots (semantic tree visible in spelling).
