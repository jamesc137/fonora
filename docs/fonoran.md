# Fonoran language guide

> **Start here** for the experimental Fonoran language and its builder at [`/fonoran/`](../fonoran/).

**Fonoran** is a constructed language written in the [Fonora phonetic script](platform-overview.md). You assign CV/CVC sounds to semantic concepts, compose roots into compound words, and approve what enters the live vocabulary. Human review is canonical: generators propose, you decide.

## Architecture

  end

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm start
# http://localhost:8000/fonoran/

npm run fonoran:build    # assign roots + build curated compounds → lab
```

## Language model

| Rule | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| **Primitive roots** | One syllable, CV or CVC. Stored in `bucket.sounds`. |
| **Words** | Stack roots and/or approved words. Stored in `bucket.compounds`. |
| **Nesting** | Approved word `kaso` can combine with root `la` → `lakaso`. |
| **Review states** | `draft` → `needs_review` → `approved` \| `rejected` \| `revised` |
| **Live vocabulary** | `data/fonoran-sound-bucket.json` (or PostgreSQL when `DATABASE_URL` is set) |

Legacy `parts: ["ka","so"]` is accepted; stored as typed `{ type, ref }` components.

```json
{ "type": "root", "ref": "ba" }
{ "type": "word", "ref": "cmp-..." }
```

Spelling = concatenation of component phonetic forms, left to right.

## Build pipeline {#pipeline}

One converged pipeline. **`npm run fonoran:build`** regenerates root spellings (locking approved ones), resolves curated compounds, validates unique segmentation, and imports into the lab.

```text
concept-inventory → root-candidates → review → fonoran:build → lab
```

| Step | What happens |
| --- | --- |
| 1. Build | `npm run fonoran:build` assigns CV/CVC spellings, builds compounds, imports lab |
| 2. Review | Open **Review** at `/fonoran/#review` — approve, reject, edit, or regenerate roots |
| 3. Rebuild | Re-run build; approved spellings stay locked; **user-created lab items are preserved** |

### Data files

| File | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `data/fonoran-concept-inventory.json` | 118 semantic concepts (no phonetics) |
| `data/fonoran-root-candidates.json` | Proposed spellings + review status |
| `data/fonoran-approved-roots.json` | Canonical approved roots |
| `data/fonoran-compounds.json` | 46 curated compound recipes |
| `data/fonoran-primitive-roots-config.json` | Phonetics rules only (onsets, vowels, codas) |
| `data/fonoran-sound-bucket.json` | Runtime lab: sounds, compounds, history |

### Commands

```bash
npm run fonoran:reset              # blank lab + review queue + canonical roots
npm run fonoran:build              # full pipeline → lab (needs review)
npm run fonoran:build:approved     # same, everything pre-approved (testing)
npm run fonoran:root-candidates    # refresh candidates only (no lab import)
```

Typical loop:

```bash
npm run fonoran:reset && npm run fonoran:build
# → Review at /fonoran/#review
# → npm run fonoran:build again after approving roots
```

### CV/CVC rule

Every primitive root is exactly **one syllable**: **CV** (`ba`, `te`) or **CVC** (`bel`, `dam`). Multi-syllable forms are compounds, not roots. Enforced at generation and at build time.

Reserved particles (never roots): `mi`, `na`, `ta`.
