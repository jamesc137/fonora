# Fonoran language lab

> **Status:** production feature at `/fonoran/` — a hand-held creative language builder.

**Fonoran** is an experimental constructed language written in the [Fonora phonetic script](platform-overview.md). This doc covers the **Language Layer** (vocabulary model) and **Language Builder Tools** (tabs and API). For the script itself, see [language-rules.md](language-rules.md) and [multilingual-support.md](multilingual-support.md).

Build a language word-by-word: create primitive roots, compose them into words, approve your choices, and explore how the vocabulary grows as a family tree.

## Quick start

```bash
npm start
# Open http://localhost:8000/fonoran/ — lander page; add #roots to jump into the builder
```

## Language model

| Rule | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| **Primitive roots** | Atomic syllables you create (CV / CVC). Stored in `bucket.sounds`. |
| **Words** | Built by stacking roots and/or approved words. Stored in `bucket.compounds`. |
| **Recursive composition** | Once `kaso = ka + so` is **approved**, you can build `lakaso = la + kaso`. |
| **Derivation tree** | Every word stores its full component tree — visible in Language Explorer. |
| **Circular derivations** | Invalid. Word A cannot depend on word B if B already depends on A. |
| **Review workflow** | `draft → needs_review → approved \| rejected \| revised` for roots and words. |
| **DDA (semantic layer)** | System-maintained, invisible during creation. Run **Run DDA** in Advanced when you've added new material. |

Your living language lives in **`data/fonoran-sound-bucket.json`** (gitignored locally) when using JSON storage, or in **PostgreSQL** when `DATABASE_URL` is set. The JSON file is imported on first boot — never deleted. Reference generator data (gen3.1 glosses for the English picker) is separate — it does not overwrite your words.

See [platform-overview.md](platform-overview.md) for storage details and [deploy.md](deploy.md) for PostgreSQL setup.

## UI tabs (Language Builder Tools)

| Tab | Builder tool | Access | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Home** | Lander | Public | Overview, live showcase, health summary |
| **Dictionary** | Dictionary + Language Explorer | **Public (read-only)** | Browse vocabulary; click any item for derivation trees and family graphs |
| **Root Creator** (Roots) | Root Creator | Sign-in required | Create primitive syllables |
| **Compound Creator** (Create Words) | Compound Creator | Sign-in required | Stack **roots** + **approved words** → preview → name → save |
| **Review** | Review Tools | Sign-in required | Approve, reject, or edit pending items |
| **Health** | Semantic Analysis | Public (read-only) | Readability scores and warnings |
| **Advanced** | DDA / lab tools | Sign-in required | Run DDA, reset lab, destructive ops |

**Language Explorer** (from Dictionary) shows: Built from · Derivation tree · Used in · Related words · Mermaid family graph. Explorer uses read-only API routes — no sign-in needed.

**Advanced:** Run DDA, compound parser, health metrics, optional debug DDA fields, lab reset. Parser (`GET /parse`) is read-only; DDA and resets require sign-in.

## API

| Endpoint | Method | Auth |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/api/fonoran/lab` | GET | Public |
| `/api/fonoran/lab/health` | GET | Public |
| `/api/fonoran/lab/graph/:kind/:ref` | GET — `kind` = `root` or `word` | Public |
| `/api/fonoran/lab/graph/preview` | POST — draft explorer graph (no save) | Public |
| `/api/fonoran/lab/parse/:spelling` | GET | Public |
| `/api/fonoran/lab/compounds` | POST `{ components: [{type, ref}], meaning }` | Sign-in |
| `/api/fonoran/lab/run-dda` | POST `{ scope: "pending" \| "stale" \| "all" }` | Sign-in |

Legacy `parts: ["ka","so"]` is still accepted; stored as typed components internally.

## Component reference

```json
{ "type": "root", "ref": "ka" }
{ "type": "word", "ref": "cmp-kaso" }
```

Spelling = concatenation of component phonetic forms left-to-right.

## Historical generators

Bulk Gen 1/Gen 2 generators were removed. How they worked: [fonoran-generator-archive.md](fonoran-generator-archive.md).

Gen 3 reference data remains for DDA inference and the English meaning picker only. Generator audit reports (`npm run fonoran:gen3:audit`, etc.) write to **`reports/`** (gitignored). Your live scores are always **Health** in the app.
