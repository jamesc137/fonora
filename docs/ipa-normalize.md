# IPA consonant normalization

Module: [`js/ipa-normalize.js`](../js/ipa-normalize.js)

Raw eSpeak IPA passes through `normalizeIpa()` before encoding.

- **Vowels** — tokens from `language-rules.md`, merged with `ENGLISH_IPA_VOWEL_NORMALIZATION` at runtime (engineering mappings while the vowel inventory is refined).
- **Consonants** — grid + derived IPA from markdown via `buildConsonantMapFromRules()`, merged with `SUPPLEMENTAL_CONSONANT_MAP` for multilingual variants.
- **Unknown IPA** — logs a warning and maps to fallback vowel phoneme `a` (never `?` in the phoneme string).

`registerConsonantMapFromRules(rules)` runs when the rules bundle loads (app startup and tests).

`npm test` includes **consonant map is built from language rules**, which fails if markdown IPA tokens are missing from the active map.

## English vowel engineering table (`ENGLISH_IPA_VOWEL_NORMALIZATION`)

Temporary mappings in `js/ipa-normalize.js` — consistency over linguistic perfection. Overrides conflicting supplemental entries (e.g. `ɚ → a` instead of `a + r`). Full audit: [IPA_VOWEL_NORMALIZATION_AUDIT.md](IPA_VOWEL_NORMALIZATION_AUDIT.md).

| IPA token | Fonora phoneme | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ɪ, i, ᵻ | i | KIT / FLEECE / weak vowel |
| ɛ, e | e | DRESS |
| æ | ae | TRAP |
| ʌ, ə, ɚ, ɜ, ɜː | a | STRUT / schwa / NURSE |
| ɔ, ɑ, o | o | LOT / THOUGHT |
| ʊ, u | u | FOOT / GOOSE |
| ɪə, iə | i | NEAR / FLEECE+schwa (engineering) |
| eə | a | SQUARE (engineering) |
| ʊə | u | CURE (engineering) |

Run `npm run audit:ipa-vowels` to regenerate the token inventory report from eSpeak en-us output.

`registerConsonantMapFromRules(rules)` runs when the rules bundle loads (app startup and tests).

`npm test` includes **consonant map is built from language rules**, which fails if markdown IPA tokens are missing from the active map.

## From language-rules.md (generated at load)

These IPA tokens appear in the Sound Grid or Derived Sounds tables. They are **built automatically** from `language-rules.md` — do not duplicate in code.

| IPA token | Fonora phoneme | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| p | p | grid plain lips |
| b | b | grid voice lips |
| t | t | grid plain front_tongue |
| d | d | grid voice front_tongue |
| tʃ | ch | grid plain middle_tongue |
| k | k | grid plain back_tongue |
| g | g | grid voice back_tongue |
| h | h | grid plain throat |
| f | f | grid friction lips |
| s | s | grid friction front_tongue |
| ʃ | sh | grid friction middle_tongue |
| x | x | grid friction back_tongue |
| m | m | grid nasal lips |
| n | n | grid nasal front_tongue |
| ɲ | ñ | grid nasal middle_tongue |
| ŋ | ng | grid nasal back_tongue |
| w | w | grid glide lips |
| j | y | grid glide back_tongue |
| r | r | grid glide middle_tongue |
| l | l | grid glide front_tongue |
| θ | th | derived th |
| ð | dh | derived dh |
| v | v | derived v |
| z | z | derived z |

Vowels and diphthongs are not in the consonant map; see vowel tables in `language-rules.md`.

## Supplemental mappings (`SUPPLEMENTAL_CONSONANT_MAP`)

These entries live in `js/ipa-normalize.js` only — not separate rows in markdown. They normalize common eSpeak IPA variants to existing Fonora phoneme keys. Rules-derived entries take precedence on conflict.

| IPA token | Fonora phoneme | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ɡ | g | Unicode g variant |
| q | k | Uvular/plosive variant → back stop |
| β | v | Voiced bilabial fricative → v |
| ʒ | j | Voiced post-alveolar → middle tongue j |
| ʎ | l | Palatal lateral → l |
| ɹ | r | English approximant |
| ɾ | t | Alveolar tap/flap (American intervocalic t/d → spelling-like `t`) |
| ɽ | r | Retroflex flap |
| ʁ | r | Voiced uvular fricative → r |
| χ | x | Voiceless uvular fricative → x |
| ɕ | sh | Alveolo-palatal fricative → sh |
| ʐ | j | Retroflex sibilant → j |
| ɣ | g | Voiced velar fricative → g |
| ç | sh | Voiceless palatal fricative → sh |
| ʈʃ | ch | Retroflex affricate → ch |
| dʒ | j | Voiced affricate → j |
| dz | j | Voiced alveolar affricate → j |
| pf | f | Labiodental affricate → f |
| kx | x | Velar + fricative cluster → x |
| ʔ | ? | Glottal stop → unknown fallback |

English **t** + **s** sequences (e.g. *outside* /aʊtsaɪd/) tokenize as separate **`t`** and **`s`** phonemes — not merged into an affricate.

When adding a **new grid or derived sound** in `language-rules.md`, add IPA tokens to the cell's `ipa` column — the map rebuilds on reload. No code change needed unless eSpeak emits IPA variants not covered by the cell notation.

When adding **new multilingual IPA** not tied to a markdown row, add to `SUPPLEMENTAL_CONSONANT_MAP` and document here.
